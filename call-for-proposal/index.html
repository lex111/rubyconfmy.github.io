        <h3>Call for Proposals</h3>
        <p>
          RubyConf KL is intended to be loosely structured and less formal,
          so we are looking <br />for presentations in many shapes and form, such as
          <span class="highlight">talks</span>,
          <span class="highlight">show & tell</span>,
          <span class="highlight">introductry workshops</span>, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Call for proposal ends at <span class="highlight">15th June 2016</span> and selected speakers will be contacted soon after.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please submit your proposals of presentation using the <br /> <a target="_blank" class="btn btn-outline-clr btn-md" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1yyaUDhuSCMWNbczyQU1DwByi9Py7fzGJs_qSjUlNYWM/viewform">submission form</a>
